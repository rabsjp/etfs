## Outline

- Motivation


- Research question


- Design


- Preliminary results


- Ongoing and future work

## Motivation 

- Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) under management are $4.3 trillion in Sep.17 (Lettau and Madhavan, 2018)

- An ETF seeks to track the performance of a specific index.

- An ongoing debate about the benefits of ETF. 

- Experiments can contribute to the discussion. 

## Research question 
How do ETFs affect

- price discovery
- trading volume
- free riding
- diversification


## Experimental Design

- single asset market of Smith, Suchanek and Williams (1988, hereafter SSW)
- we extend SSW to multiple assets (two) jointly with or without an ETF. 
- 2 x 2 design, where another factor is  correlation across assets $\rho\in (-1,0)$ 


## Experimental Design
- A, B and ETF$\rightarrow C$ , where $C= A + B$ (equal weights).
- T = 15 trading periods
- dividend streams per period, 
    - A pays 1 or -1 
    - Under $\rho=-1$, B pays the opposite of A in all periods. Starting from t=8, pays plus 1. 
- termination value of 10 for A and B.    


## Experimental Design

- Each session: 9 players, 2 set of markets
- One market is randomly paid (avoid wealth effects)
- One call market per asset
- Endowments of (A, B, C, cash) according to player type

```{r echo=FALSE, results= 'asis'}
e_1<-c(8,2,0,444)
e_2<-c(2,8,0,396)
e_3<-c(0,0,10,280)
table_endowments<-rbind(e_1,e_2,e_3)
colnames(table_endowments)<-c("A","B","C","cash")
rownames(table_endowments)<-c("type I","type II", "type III")

library(knitr)
kable(table_endowments,caption="Endowments")
```

## Experimental Design
- UI in oTree (developed by the authors)
